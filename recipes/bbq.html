    <h1>Korean BBQ Short Ribs(Galbi)</h1>  
  <img src="bbq.webp" alt="Korean BBQ Short Ribs">
 <h3>Galbi, galbi-gui, or grilled ribs is a type of gui in 
     Korean cuisine. "Galbi" is the Korean word for "rib", 
     and the dish is usually made with beef short ribs.  </h3>
<p>
This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs. You can also substitute 
chicken breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. If you use chicken or
 rib-eye, you must add thinly sliced green onion tops. This can also be broiled 
 in the oven for the same amount of time.
